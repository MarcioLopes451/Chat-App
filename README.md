# Chat-App

This Chat App allows users to:
- Send messages
- Receives Messages via an text generator api

You can view this app [here](https://marciolopes451.github.io/Chat-App/)

## Tools used:
- HTML
- TailwindCss
- Vanilla JavaScript

In short, this small project is to give the user a basic understanding of an app that allows them to communicate with others, like a social media app such as WhatsApp.
The Api I used returns Lorem Ipsum dummy text to give the user the feel of them using a social media app.
